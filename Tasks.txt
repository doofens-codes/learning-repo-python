What is AI, what is ML. 
Workflow - ML, DL, CNN, ANN, RNN, GRU, LSTM, NLP, Transformers, RL, GPT, VAE (Auto encoders), GAN, RAG
Foundation models, MCP, AI Agents.
Chat-GPT Order:
    ML Basics → Supervised/Unsupervised, metrics, scikit-learn

    ANN & DL → Build intuition, play with simple networks

    CNNs → Do image classification, digit recognizer (MNIST)

    RNN / LSTM / GRU → Time series, text generation

    NLP Basics → Tokenization, embeddings, TF-IDF

    Transformers & GPT → Hugging Face, OpenAI API, train tiny transformers

    Autoencoders & VAE → Feature compression, reconstruction
    GANs → Image generation (DCGAN, StyleGAN)
    RAG, Embeddings, LangChain → Combine LLMs with external data
    AI Agents → Multi-step reasoning, goal-based automation
    Foundation models & deployment → Working with large pre-trained models, hosting them
